#NVDI

# 1.Excellent Crop Condition:
# Description: Thriving with optimal growth and vitality. They exhibit strong and uniform development, excellent leaf coverage, and are free from pests and diseases.
# Indicators: Healthy green foliage, uniform growth, high crop density, no signs of stress, and absence of pests or diseases.
# 2.Good Crop Condition:
# Description: Generally healthy and growing well, but there may be some minor issues or variations in growth. Overall, they are productive and have the potential for a successful harvest.
# Indicators: Satisfactory growth, moderate uniformity, minimal signs of stress, and effective management of minor issues such as pests or nutrient deficiencies.
# 3.Fair Crop Condition:
# Description: May exhibit noticeable stress or challenges that affect their development. There might be some areas of slower growth, signs of pests or diseases, or other factors impacting overall crop health.
# Indicators: Visible stress, uneven growth, presence of pests or diseases that require management, and moderate impact on overall crop productivity.
# 4.Poor Crop Condition:
# Description: Crops are struggling and face significant challenges that hinder their growth and productivity. This may include severe pest infestations, diseases, nutrient deficiencies, or adverse environmental conditions.
# Indicators: Severe stress, stunted or distorted growth, widespread presence of pests or diseases, and a substantial negative impact on crop yield and quality.

#NDMI

#1.Optimal Soil Moisture:
# Description: Soil moisture is at an ideal level for plant growth and development. There is sufficient water for crops, promoting healthy root systems and robust vegetation.
# Indicators: Soil feels moist but not waterlogged, and crops show no signs of water stress.
# 2.Adequate Soil Moisture:
# Description: Soil moisture is sufficient for crop growth, but it may not be at the optimal level. Crops are adequately supplied with water, and growth is generally good.
# Indicators: Soil feels moderately moist, and crops are growing well without signs of wilting.
# 3.Moderate Soil Moisture Stress:
# Description: Soil moisture is becoming limiting, and crops may experience stress. There is a need for additional irrigation to maintain optimal growth.
# Indicators: Soil is drying out, and crops may show signs of wilting or stress, especially during the hottest parts of the day.
# 4.Severe Soil Moisture Stress:
# Description: Soil moisture is critically low, significantly impacting crop growth. Crops are under severe water stress, and there is an urgent need for irrigation or rainfall.
# Indicators: Soil is dry, crops are visibly stressed, leaves may curl or droop, and there is a risk of yield reduction.
