Explanation:

Import libraries: We import libraries for data splitting, scaling (optional), and a RandomForestClassifier model (replace with your chosen model).

Data loading functions: Replace these with your functions to load and process remote sensing data (X) and recommended agricultural practices (y).

Load data: Call your data loading functions to get features and target variables.

Split data: Split the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Feature scaling (optional): Standardize features (if necessary) using StandardScaler for better model performance with some algorithms.

Create the model: Choose a suitable supervised learning model based on your problem (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine).

Train the model: Train the model on the training data.

Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict recommended practices for the testing data.

Evaluation (optional): Implement metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) to assess model performance on the testing set.

Prediction function: Define a function predict_practice to take new remote sensing data, preprocess it (if necessary), and predict the recommended practice using the trained model.

Note:

This is a skeleton code. Replace data loading functions and choose the appropriate model based on your specific data and problem.

Consider incorporating feature engineering techniques to extract additional information from the remote sensing data.

Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Remember to handle potential errors and data quality issues in real-world applications.
